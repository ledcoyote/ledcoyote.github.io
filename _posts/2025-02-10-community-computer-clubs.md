# Community Computer Clubs

Recently I've been thinking about the technological ecosystem. It has evolved
over the decades from a scrappy, loosely-connected community of enthusiasts to
the scene of some of the world's largest companies. This shift was largely
economically driven. The advent of e-commerce showed business that they had much
to be gained by "going digital." The traditional marketing formulas centered
around locale (the "place" member of the _4 Ps of marketing_ took on a different
character altogether) were upended, and logistical innovations unlocked
seemingly endless scale, as the rise of giants like Amazon can attest. There are
of course many factors and fierce competition, but it's clear that the character
of technology in all of our lives is nearly unrecognizable from the standpoint
of the pre-2000s era.

The move of information technology from the margins to the center of business
demanded much higher scale, elasticity, and service level than were available
before. Accordingly, technologists and businesses have delivered. Today, most
people considering a digital business would never think of self-hosting their
infrastructure (there are, of course, exceptions) and will turn to a cloud
provider for the provisioning of servers, the largest being AWS, Google, and
Microsoft. Although there is clear competition and innovation among these
providers—one receives a whole "ecosystem" of services—one is in effect choosing
one feudal lord over another for their leige.

## Tech Feudalism

I first heard of this idea from a
[blog post by Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2012/11/when_it_comes_to_sec.html)
awhile back. Bruce talks about this idea mainly through the lens of user
security, and the ramifications are manifold. The choices available to a user
(or business) will be circumscribed by the choices of the provider. Also,
control over many aspects of service operation, including security, are shifted
to the provider, which can be a good thing, as he says. Shifting providers is
costly (though not impossible).

It is worth thinking about what is given up, though. In a
[previous post](/blog/linux-boxes-all-the-way-down.html) I talked about how
believing in cloud abstractions limits the ability of a technologist to
understand and influence their operation—it takes away some of their power.
Obviously, this can be good and useful, so far as the technology behaves as
expected. Abstraction also removes humans and materials from consideration,
including their suffering and impacts on the Earth, and I think this is a
unalloyed bad thing.

## Gardening

Today, much of our nutrition is provided by enormous agricultural and food
processing businesses. Many people have little conception of where their food
comes from and the processes (largely fossil fuel driven) that produce it. They
have little thought for the lives taken to produce meat. Other than during
extraordinary circumstances such as a disaster or logistical disruption, we
don't really have to worry about the availability of food either. If we go to
the grocery store, we will usually find what we want. When we visit a restaurant
whatever food we desire appears before us in a matter of minutes.

This situation is pretty similar to the one we find ourselves within in the
technology ecosystem. While the need for data does not rise to the same level as
the need for food, in a lot of ways our modern lives do depend on its
provisioning. There are differences, though. In particular, the food industry is
regulated to a level that the technology industry does not even begin to
approach. We depend on the proper functioning of systems and regulations to
detect and pull sickening food products from our grocery shelves, to ensure that
they are properly labeled for ingredients and nutrients, and that they are
safely and (to perhaps an insufficient degree) ethically sourced. As the digital
domain grows to affect more of our lives, I think we should expect and demand
that the technological analogues of these regulations be put into practice and
enforced.

With regards to mindfulness, we can learn from food systems as we consider our
technological options. Many people keep a garden or raise backyard chickens.
While it is impossible for most people to subside solely on the food that they
produce themselves, they derive considerable pleasure from being involved with
the production of some amount of their food. Growing a garden and getting one's
hands dirty puts one in the place where it happens and teaches one about the
processes, challenges, and pleasures of growing food.

## Community Computing

Many communities have "community gardens" in which a group of people cooperates
to grow and tend a food garden together, and they all reap the proceeds at
harvest time. It is a communal activity, bringing people together, and can
produce a surprising quantity of food (though, again, typically not enough for
the community to survive on). I think that this model is one that technologists
can emulate, what could be called a "community computer club."

Purchasing, configuring, and running physical servers is something of a lost art
these days. Though it is _entirely possible_. Modest servers may be purchased
relatively cheaply (especially used or refurbished) and can be run on free and
open source software (FOSS). Indeed, nearly all commercial cloud infrastructure
runs on FOSS. There are many skills that running servers oneself can teach:
security (physical and otherwise), reliability and disaster recovery, system
administration, governance, and many more.

The infrastructure thus provided may be used to serve applications that are of
use and interest to the community—the club members themselves, or to others as
granted by the club. Governance could take many forms, but I envision a club
that I would like to be part of having the following characteristics:

- democratic or consensus decision making
- is local—its members physically meet when feasible
- self-reliant, in that it self-hosts as much as feasible
- does its work in the open
- employs used or refurbished hardware to minimize environmental and social
  impact
- is women and LGBTQIA+ welcoming and supporting
- makes its infrastructure available to like-minded organizations in the local
  community at a realistic level of service

Like a community or personal garden, such infrastructure is unlikely to be able
to meet all the information technology needs of its members, but also like a
garden it can provide them with community, mindfulness, learning, and fun. It
doesn't break the stranglehold and power of our technological feudal overlords,
but it can expose its members to another way of doing things.
